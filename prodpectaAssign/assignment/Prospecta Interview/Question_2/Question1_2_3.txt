
Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:



I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results. If it is a value, 
then return a value. If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.

1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

2. What type of errors you would you check for?

3. How might a user break your code?
